    <h1>Amanda's Favorite Things About School</h1>
    <h2>By Amanda Rogers</h2>

    <p><mark>Big Question:</mark> What is your favorite thing about school?</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>I enjoy many things about EPS</p>
    <p>I like:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The classes</li>
        <li>The teachers</li>
        <li>The strong community</li>
        <li>The food</li>
        <li>My friends</li>
        <li>The Tali 3rd floor (specifically the section outside Ms. McKinney's office)</li>
        <li>The square couches in Tali</li>
        <li>Mr. Sterninsky (he is awsome)</li>
        <li>And so much more</li>
    </ol>

    <p>My favorite thing about school though are the EBC trips. I went to Catalina Island off the coast of LA for a 6
        day back packing trip and absolutely loved it.
        I saw so many new animals, met new people, strengthened my relationships with my teachers and friends, as well
        as I got to go for a sunrise hike.
        EBC week is my favorite week out of the entire year, and they keep getting better. I hope to continue to do more
        outdoor trip (hopefully backpacking) in different parts of the world.

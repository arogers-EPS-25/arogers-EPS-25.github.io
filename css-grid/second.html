            <h2>Before</h2>
            <p> The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks
                and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her
                initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic
                Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
                Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over
                her cheek. </p>

            <h3>The Original Path</h3>
            <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the
                blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
                ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It
                is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the
                all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day
                however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided. </p>

            <h3>The New Way</h3>
            <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
                enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created
                for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of
                mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at
                the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was greater.</p>

            <h2>The Great End</h2>
            <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
                horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
                brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to
                cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size
                of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't
                a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four
                familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling
                salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and
                housed in a </p>

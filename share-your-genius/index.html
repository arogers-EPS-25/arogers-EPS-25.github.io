        <h3 class="center-text">By: Amanda Rogers</h2>

            <p> I am very passionate about horseback riding. I started horseback riding because my grandfather was super
                into horses. He had over 25 horses and he did a sport called cutting. I bought my own horse in 2019 and
                I use him for trail riding in Tolt McDonald park (it is 1 minute walking from my house). My horse is
                named Pickles and he is a Quarter Horse. I also lease a show jumping horse named Armani. He is a
                Thoroughbred. There are many different breeds of horses and they are good at many different things.
            </p>

            <p> During the summer, I fly by myself to Dallas, Texas to ride and show cutting horses in
                Texas and Oklahoma. I stay by myself in my trainor's house for 4-8 weeks during the summer. I work in
                the barn, in
                the house, and I help to ride the horses and train the baby horses. Horseback riding is my favorite
                thing to
                do. It is an incredible sport and the people are fun to hangout with. I love to train horses as well as
                I love just hanging out with them. My life 100% revolves around
                horses and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
